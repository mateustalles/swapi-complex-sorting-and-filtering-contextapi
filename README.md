# Project Star Wars Planets Table with React Context API and complex sorting and filtering

This is the 16th project from my software development course at Trybe, however I'm refactoring it now so that I can provide better code writing and also to implement complex sorting filters for the table columns, which will rank up on priorities and re-sort the previous sorting filtering by ascending or descending order.

Also, the filter orderings will be improved.

I'll be also using Bootstrap React as a quick solution for design, and I will also provide a "tour" for the website when the user opens it up.

A CRUD will be also implemented, but only on sessionStorage due to this is mainly a front-end project.

This project host on this Heroku URL:
